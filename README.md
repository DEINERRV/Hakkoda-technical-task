# Hakkoda-technical-task

To complete the technical task, I utilized the Snowflake web app.<br>
I uploaded the CSV file by selecting the appropriate database and dropping the file into the interface; subsequently, I specified the file format that I had established.<br>
For the dashboard, I opted for Sigma BI.<br>
I created some views for the metrics and crafted additional ones within Sigma itself.
